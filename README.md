DYNamical BInary EVolution

A collaborative effort to construct a binary population synthesis code
in which the orbital evolution is calculated using a general-purpose
N-body code and the stellar evolution by a general purpose stellar
evolution code.

The objective is to eventually, be able to resplace the binary
population synthesis modeules in N-body codes by more general-purpose
(but slower) prescription for the binary evolution in which the
dynamics is taken care of by the N-body code.

Initial discussions started on 27 January 2020 between:
Nicola Giacobbo
Iorio Giuliano
Simon Portegies Zwart
Steven Rieder
Alessandro Trani
Long Wang
